This program was an assignment for one of your college courses, but it came out not so bad, so I decided to make a repository for it.

This program is simple winter scene using particle system for fireworks and snow.

program can be compiled on windows with following steps:
1. "cmake ." in directory where you cloned this repo.
2. "cmake --build . --config Release" in same directory.


Program should look like this when run.
